// update 2016

as i need to gather scope for my own code & art research, operated by deploying art installation, musical & visual runtime algorithmical compositions/programs since the late 90's that are almost medium free, the object files and source code presented in this repository are published externally at github so that i dont loose all this precious code again -- it took me a couple of years to find it. hours and years of labour and self teaching into the arts of programming have been put into the creation of these files. unfortunatly most of these files do not work at present time (ie, present Max7/OSX versions, but they still probably do with Max3,4/MacOS8.6/9,), and probably should not be too hard for a Max programmer to adapt & compile the source code and make it run on his system, if he wishes too. if any Max user has used these objects before, you can find the source code here which will probably need some adaptor or something of a kind.

currently i am using other systems to make my art, so i offer the source code licensed under LGPL, the original License these objects were under over the years i used Max, i plan to adapt every single algorithm i devised while working on this system for my own creations, and expand further than that.

a note for the seasoned programmer: apologies for the code quality, and the scratch/sketch like very infantile approach, but, in the end, infantile dreams are the only reason certain particles are still organized in certain ways
