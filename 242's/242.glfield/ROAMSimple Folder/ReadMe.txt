ROAM Simplistic ImplementationBy Bryan Turnerbrturn@bellsouth.netJanuary, 2000Project file for MS Visual C++ 6.0.Requires GLUT DLL (www.opengl.org)Adjust program constants in Landscape.h and Utility.cpp.MAPS:  Default map is read from HeghtXXX.raw where XXX is the MAP_SIZE(as defined in Landscape.h).  If this map is not found, the programattempts to open "Map.ved", a Tread Marks map file.  Tread Marks mapswill only work for MAP_SIZE == 1024.  Also, the MULT_SCALE to viewTread Marks maps correctly is "0.25f".
